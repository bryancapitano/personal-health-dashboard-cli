# 📊 Personal Health Dashboard (CLI)

A terminal-based **Personal Health Dashboard** built as my **Harvard CS50P Final Project**.  
This v0.1 prototype explores how wearable-exported data (Fitbit CSV/JSON files) can be parsed, analyzed, and visualized directly in the terminal using Python and the Rich library.

Future versions will evolve into a full-stack web application with expanded analytics, dashboards, and integrations.


## 🚀 Project Goals (v0.1)

- Demonstrate Python fundamentals learned in CS50P  
- Practice **object-oriented design** for reusable dashboard components  
- Parse and validate locally exported Fitbit data (CSV / JSON)  
- Display core metrics: steps, heart rate, sleep, activity, etc.  
- Use **Rich** panels, tables, and layouts for a clean terminal UI  
- Render simple charts directly in the terminal using **Plotext**  
- Serve as a proof-of-concept for a future web app version (v1.0+)


## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12** (developed and tested on 3.12)  
- **Rich** for terminal UI (panels, tables, layouts)  
- **Plotext** for inline terminal charts / ASCII visualizations  
- **CSV** / **JSON** parsing  
- **Pathlib**, **datetime**, and other standard library tools  
- **Object-oriented Python** to organize dashboard modules and views


## 🌱 Why I Built This

I’m building this project as part of my transition into software engineering, combining my passion for personal health metrics with the skills I’ve gained in Harvard’s CS50P course. This command-line prototype is the first step toward a larger vision: a full-stack Personal Health Dashboard that integrates wearables, labs, lifestyle data, and future AI-driven insights.
