# personal-health-dashboard-cli
A terminal-based Personal Health Dashboard built for my Harvard CS50P final project. Displays insights from Fitbit-exported data (steps, sleep, heart rate, activity) using Python, Rich, and CSV/JSON parsing. A v0.1 proof of concept for a future full-stack web application.
